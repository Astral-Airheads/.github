# Astral Airheads

Just an GitHub organization with only me in it since my fellow friend in this duo isn't a programmer like me :/

**WE SUPPORT FREE AND OPEN-SOURCE SOFTEWARES**

This may contain some random open-source stuff that I (matt) might upload from some random TikTok or YouTube video that we've made if I even want to,
or some actual projects that I made that I would like to upload on the behalf of this duo (me and Larz).

If you wanna contact us, just send us an [e-mail](mailto:astralairheads@gmail.com). If I may have mistakenly violated some license terms or something
on one of the repositories, just **PLEASE** contact us ASAP.
